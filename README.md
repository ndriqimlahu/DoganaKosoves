<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project called `Dogana e Kosoves` is a data analysis and visualization project where are showed the open data which are analyzed and visualized based on the trade balance according to a certain year, it is also worth mentioning that Kosovo Customs for each year compiles an annual report which contains the main data on developments in Customs during that year. These annual reports are the best form of transparency, because the whole activity is summarized in a single report which is made public.
